//1. VARIABLES & DATATYPES 	
//A. Q+A
	// 1. We assign a value to a variable using const and let.
	// What is on the right of the "=" is the value assigned
	// to what's on the left of the "=".
	// 2. We change the value of a variable using
	// let. Then we declare whatever variable we want to change,
	// equal to what we want to change it to.
	// It looks like this let Variable = 1; Variable = 2; 
	// 3. We assign an existing variable to a new variable
	// by putting the new variable on the let side of the
	// "=" and the old variable. 
	// 4. Declaring a variable is the 'let' or 'const'. You're
	// declaring a variable. The assigning is th '='.
	// And the defining is what you put on the right side
	// of the '='. That is seting the value to the variable.
	// 5. Pseudocoding is writing out what exact steps you
	// are wanting to take in order to do your code. 
	// Pseudocode is writen in plain engligh, not in code. 
	// And for that reason pseudocode is a great way to break
	// down complicated code.
	// Probably 70% of your time should be committed to
	// planning and solving your code.
